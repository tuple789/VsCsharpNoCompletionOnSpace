# VsCsharpNoCompletionOnSpace

The toggle the completion mode in Visual Studio for C# is automatically set to "complete when you press space". You can of course 
press the toggle buttons to disable that behaviour, however you have to do it EVERYTIME you launch visual Studio, as there
is no way to "save" that behaviour.
This extension for Visual Commander makes sure you will never have to press that button again.

## Install:

- First install the [Visual Commander extension for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SergeyVlasov.VisualCommander).
- Download this repository (Clone or Download button) and extract DisableSpaceCompletion.vcmd from the .zip
- Install DisableSpaceCompletion.vcmd by going in Visual Studio:
  - Vcmd menu -> Import -> choose DisableSpaceCompletion.vcmd
  - Vcmd menu -> Extensions -> make sure Disable Space Completion is ticked (tick it on and off just to be sure)
  - RESTART VISUAL STUDIO (very important otherwise it might not work)
  
This is my first extension, but so far it works great, i hope you enjoy it.
